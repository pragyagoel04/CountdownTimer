###Total time spent
About 40 minutes
###Tools used
Html, Css, Javascript, Jquery, Bootstap
IDE: Sublime Text 2
###Bugs/Improvement
We can add the number of remaining days, instead of total number of hours. We can do that by dividing the hours by 24 and display it on our view.
###Testing
Tested on all popular browsers: Chrome, Safari, Firefox.
The page is responsive using @media tag. It can be tested by decreasing the window size.
